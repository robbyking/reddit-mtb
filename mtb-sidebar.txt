#### Reddit for mountain bikers. ####

Need help choosing a bike, finding places to ride, or just want advice on technique, gear, or cycling etiquette? Please post in the *[Weekly New Rider Thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/MTB/search?q=title%3AWeekly+New+Rider&restrict_sr=on&sort=new&t=all)* or the *[Weekly Gear Thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/MTB/search?q=Weekly+Gear+Thread+&restrict_sr=on&sort=new&t=all)*, posted each week by /u/AutoModerator.

Also, don't forget to post were you rode this weekend in the *[Weekend Ride Report Thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/MTB/search?q=title%3AWeekend+Ride+Report&restrict_sr=on&sort=new&t=all)*, posted each Monday.

Please follow proper [reddiquette](http://www.reddit.com/help/reddiquette), and if you haven't already, take a moment to [read our wiki page](http://www.reddit.com/r/MTB/wiki/index) and learn a bit about the [site's history](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=5U-NCG1zZds).

Remember to vote based on quality, not opinion, and keep your submission titles factual and opinion-free. Do *not* downvote opinions just because you disagree with them.

On the other hand, be generous with upvotes. They are free, after all.

A couple quick rules for submissions:

* No karma-baiting or cryptic post titles.

* No fundraising.

* No image macros, Rage Comics, meme pics/meme speak, or static bike and trail photos.

The general rule is photo and video submissions to /r/mtb should be of people *riding* mountain bikes. If you want to submit a trail or bike photo instead – your new bike leaning against a tree, or the view from top of the trail, for example – submit your link as a text post and include some details and context, [like this](http://www.reddit.com/r/MTB/comments/31nqoh/new_bike_day_commencal_meta_am_v4/).

If you think your post was removed by mistake, use the [*message the moderators*](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FMTB) link in the sidebar and include a link to your post. (Otherwise we'll ignore it. We are busy, after all.)
